<h2>Why to visit Kashmir?</h2></p>
<p>Kashmir has everything including mountains, dense forests, green meadows, grasslands, and water streams that together create wonderful scenery. From Aru Valley to Saffron fields, Zabarwan Mountain range to the Chashme Shahi, Badam Vari to Apple Garden, Almond trees to Chinar Tress, all these naturally beautiful locations make Kashmir a Heaven on Earth. Gulmarg, Pahalgam & Sonmarg are some such marvelous locations that everyone loves to visit repeatedly.</p>
<p> The tranquillity of the crystal clear Dal Lake and Nigeen Lake in Srinagar along with the magical backdrop of the mountains is simply incomparable.</p>
<p> Kashmir is not only limited to its beautiful landscapes. You can see the richness of Kashmiri culture in the handiworks of the locals in the form of Kashmiri handlooms, Pashmina and Ferins that are often sold here. It is also the perfect place for taking part in adventurous activities such as a trek through the lakes or skiing in Gulmarg.</p>
